/* 




TODO: Given a positive integer num, return true if num is a perfect square or false otherwise.

? A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. 
In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

* You must not use any built-in library function, such as sqrt.

var isPerfectSquare = function (num) {

isPerfectSquare(16);
/* 
Output: true
Explanation: We return true because 4 * 4 = 16 and 4 is an integer.
